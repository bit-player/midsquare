# The Middle Square Algorithm for Pseudorandom Numbers

The code in this repository accompanies the essay "The Middle of the Square," by Brian Hayes, published July 2022 at [http://bit-player.org/2022/the-middle-of-the-square](http://bit-player.org/2022/the-middle-of-the-square). 

The program implements the pseudorandom number generator invented in the 1940s by John von Neumann, illustrating its principal failing: a short cycle length.
